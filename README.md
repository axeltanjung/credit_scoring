These exclusions may arise due to data inconsistencies, data quality issues, or other sample selection biases that could potentially skew the analysis and compromise the accuracy of the credit scoring model.

Reject:

The 'Reject' status refers to cases where applicants are not selected for credit approval, as determined by the lender. These cases represent instances where the lender deems the applicant to be ineligible for credit, typically due to factors such as a high-risk profile, poor credit history, or inadequate financial standing.

Not Taken Up (NTU):

'Not Taken Up' signifies cases where applicants are selected for credit but do not proceed with the credit facility, despite being approved by the lender. This status often arises when the borrower chooses not to utilize the credit product, even after meeting the lender's criteria for approval.

Mutual Accept:

'Mutual Accept' represents cases where the selected applicants have accepted and utilized the credit facility provided by the lender, either responsibly or in a manner that indicates potential credit misuse or abuse.

Outcome/Performance Statuses:

Good:

The 'Good' status signifies desirable outcomes, such as timely payments, responsible credit utilization, and a positive credit performance, reflecting a borrower's ability to manage credit responsibly and meet their financial obligations effectively.

Bad:

The 'Bad' status refers to undesirable outcomes, including instances of default, delinquency, or any other adverse credit events that indicate a high level of credit risk and potential financial instability.

Indeterminate:

The 'Indeterminate' status represents outcomes that fall between the 'Good' and 'Bad' categories, indicating a moderate level of credit risk or uncertainty in the borrower's credit behavior. This optional category allows for the nuanced classification of cases that do not distinctly fit into either the 'Good' or 'Bad' classification.

Excludes:

The 'Excludes' category encompasses any outcomes that lie outside the intended scope of the credit scoring model, such as operational-risk events or fraudulent activities that may impact the overall risk assessment but are not directly related to the borrower's credit behavior.

In the final scorecard development, the use of the 'Good' and 'Bad' classifications enables the Credit Card Product division to establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants, facilitating more accurate risk assessments and informed credit decisions.

C.	Performance and Sample Windows

Performance Window:

The performance window refers to the designated time frame during which the credit performance of accounts is continuously monitored and assessed to assign specific performance targets. This window allows for the evaluation of the borrower's credit behavior over a defined period, enabling the identification of patterns, trends, and potential risks associated with the borrower's repayment patterns and credit utilization habits.

Sample Window:

The sample window denotes the specific time frame from which known 'good' and 'bad' cases are selected for the sample dataset. This window serves as the basis for selecting historical data to train and validate the credit scoring model, facilitating the identification of key variables and patterns that contribute to the differentiation between creditworthy and high-risk applicants.

Furthermore, there are several approaches to determining the sample and performance windows, including:

Basel II:

This approach, as defined by the Basel II framework, emphasizes the use of historical data and specific time frames to assess credit risk and establish adequate capital requirements, ensuring that financial institutions maintain sufficient capital reserves to cover potential credit losses within a defined time horizon.

"Decision Horizon" Approach from IFRS 9:

The "Decision Horizon" approach, as outlined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, emphasizes the evaluation of the credit performance of accounts within a specific time frame to assess expected credit losses accurately and facilitate effective risk management practices within the banking sector.

Portfolio Maturity Using Cohort/Vintage Analysis:

This approach involves the analysis of portfolio maturity through cohort or vintage analysis, enabling the identification of specific cohorts or groups of accounts with similar origination dates to assess their credit performance and behavior over time. This analysis aids in the understanding of the credit risk dynamics associated with different borrower segments within the portfolio.

By leveraging these diverse approaches, the Credit Card Product division of Amara Bank can effectively determine the performance and sample windows, enabling the accurate assessment of credit risk, the identification of key trends, and the development of a robust credit scoring model tailored to the unique dynamics of the credit card market.
